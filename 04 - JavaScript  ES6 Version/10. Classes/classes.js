//---------------------------CLASSES IN ES6------------------------------

/*
    Classes actually don't add anything new to the language, they're just synthetic sugar.
    here synthetic sugar. means syntax that is designed to make things easier to read, but doesnâ€™t introduce anything new.

    We can say that Classes are the ALTERNATIVE and more advanced  way of implementing INHERITANCE 
    
    Earlier in ES5 INHERITANCE can only be implemented through
    
    "PROTOTYPE PROPERTY" without PROTOTYPE PROPERTY and PROTOTYPE CHAIN its nearly impossible to implement INHERITANCE .
     
     ES6 comes up with more efficent and eassy way to implement INHERITANCE in JS i.e  through "CLASSES"

/*

    Lets recall how we implement INHERITANCE in ES5 
    
    1.First We create a FUNCTION CONSTRUCTOR (parent object) which acts as a BLUE PRINT for craeting new INSTANCES (child object).
    
    2. Then we create a PROTOTYPE PROTOTYPE of FUNCTION CONSTRUCTOR.
    
    3. After craeting PROTOTYPE PROTOTYPE of FUNCTION CONSTRUCTOR.Now we add all the METHODS and PROPERTIES which we want to inherit
       in newly created object inside the PROTOTYPE PROPERTY of FUNCTION CONSTRUCTOR (parent object).

/*

    If we use STATIC METHOD inside the class attached to a method then we can not access or use 
    that method with new objects or INSTANCES which is inherited from BLUE PRINT.
    
    above is the example of STATIC METHOD 
    
    and we can also observe that we can only access STATIC METHOD by class name  but not with INSTANCES created 
    
    means 
    
    it can be accessed by ----->  Person6.demo();
    
    it can not be accessed by -------->  jhon6.demo();
